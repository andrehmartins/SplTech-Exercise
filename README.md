SplTech job interview exercise

Started by creating the class Rack, which has the methods for sorting and adding new balls.
First it's asked to the user what is the number drawned, and after writing it, it is printed the numbers of the balls that are in the rack.
The sorting algorithm used is an insertion sort because we have a reduced numbers of balls to sort (60 balls max) and when we add a new ball the rack is sorted, so it's time complexity is O(n), it's efficient.
